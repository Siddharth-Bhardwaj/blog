            <p>The model is talking about booking her latest gig, modeling WordPress underwear
                in the brand latest Perfectly Fit campaign, which was shot by Lachian Bailey.

            <p>So simple, yet so essential, the white shirt is the foundation of any wardrobe.
                It’s also the most multi-functional item, taking you from work to play with just 
                the quick unfastening of a couple of buttons.

            <span>You must learn one thing. The world was made to be free in. Give up all the other worlds.</span>
            <p>There was a time in the industry not too long ago, when it seemed that the high fashion world was 
                using plus size models as a headline-grabbing gimmick see the groundbreaking cover.

                A muscular, sturdy dog with a peculiar look, Bulldog may not easily be the most popular breed as a pet. 
                But don’t be deceived by its looks because Bulldogs are cuddly and loving.

            <span>If You Have It, You Can Make Anything Look Good</span>
            <p>The main thing that you have to remember on this journey is just be nice to everyone and always smile. 
                Refreshingly, what was expected of her was the same thing that was expected of Lara Stone: to take a 
                beautiful picture. We woke reasonably late following the feast and free flowing wine the night before. 
                After gathering ourselves and our packs, we headed down to our homestay family’s small dining room for 
                breakfast, where we enjoyed scrambled eggs, toast, mekitsi (fried dough), local jam and peppermint tea.

                There was a time in the industry not too long ago, when it seemed that the high fashion world was using 
                plus size models as a headline-grabbing gimmick see the groundbreaking Italian Vogue cover featuring Tara 
                Lynn, Candice Huffine, and Robyn Lawley in June 2016.
